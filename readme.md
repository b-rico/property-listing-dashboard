# Data Visualization and Analysis Repository

## Overview

This repository contains configuration files, layout information, and settings for a data visualization and analysis project. The project leverages JSON-based configurations for editor settings, diagrams, models, and reports, which are used for creating and managing data visualizations effectively.

## Repository Contents

- **editorSettings.json**: Configures settings for relationship detection, type detection, and query loading, ensuring an optimal user experience when managing data relationships in the visualization editor.
- **localSettings.json**: Stores user consent information and references to remote artifacts, such as datasets. It also includes security settings for data usage.
- **diagramLayout.json**: Defines the layout for diagrams, including node positioning and zoom values. This file also manages how tables are visually represented, aiding in efficient navigation and data analysis.
- **report.json**: Contains report configurations and filters for visualizing data, including themes, filter settings, and layout optimization parameters. It defines how data is presented in reports, including visual containers and default display properties.

## Usage

1. **Configuration Setup**: Ensure that the `editorSettings.json` and `localSettings.json` files are properly configured for your environment. These files control data relationships and security settings, respectively.
2. **Diagram Management**: Use `diagramLayout.json` to modify or update the layout of the diagrams. This file includes the positioning of nodes, table visibility settings, and default views.
3. **Report Generation**: Customize the `report.json` file to control report themes, filter options, and visualizations. This file is critical for ensuring the reports are accessible, informative, and aligned with the project's theme.

## Getting Started
